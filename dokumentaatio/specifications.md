# ImageChatter


The app offers a change to create an anonym chat for any picture online. For example, you can paste an image URL to ImageChatter which opens the chat about the image. The user will se all the messages added before plus additional information about the image's history on the app (when added first by who etc.). The source of the image does not matter, only the rgb-values. This is especially useful today because lots of disinformative pictures are circluating on social media and there exists no common place to talk about them.
