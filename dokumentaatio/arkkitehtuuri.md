## Structure

## User interface

The user interface follows the Model-View-Controller model. It has a total of three views:

- log in
- creating a new user
- searching for images and senging messages (main view).

Views are implemented by FXML-files which can be found in *src/main/resources/gui*. All of the views have their own Controller which can be found in *imagechatter.gui*.

The controllers are connected to different logic classes. Controllers for Login and creating a new user use the UserLogic class. Controller for the main view uses the userLogic, imageLogic and chatLogic classes.


# Application logic

The application logic consists of the three above mentioned logic classes to increase the cohesiveness. Principal goal of the split is to diffrenetiate the logic of three core functionalities -- user, image and chat.
